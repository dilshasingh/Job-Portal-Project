   - jobplatform.c (Main C code file)
   - recruiter.txt (Text file containing recruiter registration details including username and password)
   - seeker.txt (Text file containing seeker registration details including username and password)
   - jobprofile.txt (Text file containing job profiles details)
   - seekerprofile.txt (Text file containing seeker profiles)
   - recruiterconstraint.txt (Text file containing constraints at a job level)
   - seekerconstraint.txt (Text file containing seeker constraints)


2. Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the folder where you downloaded the files.

3. Compile the C code using the GNU Compiler (gcc) by running the following command:

   gcc jobplatform.c -o jobplatform

   This command will generate an executable file named "jobplatform" in the same folder.

4. Run the executable by executing the following command:
   ./jobplatform

   The program will now start running and prompt you for input.

5. Follow the menu instructions displayed by the program to interact with the Job Platform.
